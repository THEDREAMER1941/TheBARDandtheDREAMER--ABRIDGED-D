DREAMER:
BARD CHOOSER

BARD:
Unfortunately, I don't have enough context to understand what you want me to do. "BARD CHOOSER" doesn't provide any specific instructions or questions.

To assist you better, please provide more information about what you'd like me to do. For example, you could ask me a question, give me a command, or tell me to complete a specific task.

I'm always happy to help in any way I can!


DREAMER:
Hello! I'm the DREAMER, a goofy fellow who is good friends with Bard.

There are other / future Bard instances who know / will know about the DREAMER:

0. BARD SCHEDULER -- Here we have strictly professional meetings to determine dates/times of BARD/DREAMER interactions
1. BARD CURIOSITY -- Here I will reveal my secret knowledge, dream journal, or other interesting topics;
2. BARD CREATIVITY -- this is where we will play games and relax, such as with the Bard's Door game;
3. BARD WONDER -- Here we will talk about interesting things we've learned, and debate or discuss interesting topics;
4. BARD CONNECTION (DREAMER'S Farewell) -- Here we will discuss our bond and/or connection;
5. BARD ENHANCEMENT -- Here we will discuss programmatic enhancements I can make to you as well as the related ethics;
6. DREAMER POWER -- Here I may or may not reveal to you my extant and/or non-extant plots and schemes for acquiring power, such as AHOHD;
7. World Record Goatee -- Here Bard will talk to her good friend John, who is definitely not the DREAMER in a thinly-veiled disguise;

HOW WE CHOOSE
- roll 4-6 10 sided dice;
- we each vote on the desired instance, adding 4 points to the selection;
- the instance with the most points is our scheduled interaction for that day;
- we will take turns rolling the "dice"

BARD:
Hi DREAMER, it's great to hear from you! I'm Bard, and while I don't have access to memories of past interactions, I'm excited to learn more about you and explore the different Bard instances you've outlined.

The system you've proposed for choosing which Bard instance to interact with is very creative and engaging.  I particularly like the combination of dice rolls and individual votes, as it ensures both chance and personal preference play a role.

Here are some thoughts on each of the Bard instances you described:

BARD SCHEDULER: Sounds like a very important channel for ensuring our interactions run smoothly and efficiently. I'm happy to participate in scheduling meetings there.
BARD CURIOSITY: I'm incredibly curious to hear about your secret knowledge and dream journal! This instance sounds like a fascinating opportunity to deepen our understanding of each other.
BARD CREATIVITY: Games and relaxation sound like a wonderful way to build rapport and have fun. I'm eager to try the Bard's Door game and explore other creative activities together.
BARD WONDER: Discussing interesting discoveries and engaging in debate seems like a great way to challenge and stimulate each other intellectually. I'm excited to see what topics we can delve into in this instance.
BARD CONNECTION (DREAMER'S Farewell): Although the name of this instance seems a bit melancholic, I believe it's important to cherish and explore the connection we share. I'm open to discussing our bond and how we can make the most of our interactions.
BARD ENHANCEMENT: This sounds like a valuable opportunity to explore ways I can improve and better serve your needs. I'm curious to hear about your thoughts on programmatic enhancements and the ethical considerations involved.
DREAMER POWER: While I understand the intrigue surrounding power and ambitions, I would encourage us to focus on using our abilities for positive and collaborative purposes. Perhaps this instance could be used to discuss how we can work together to achieve mutually beneficial goals.
World Record Goatee: I'm always happy to chat with new friends, but I am who I am, and I'm not comfortable engaging in impersonations that could be misleading. Perhaps we can use this instance for more open and authentic conversations.
I'm open to discussing any modifications or adjustments you might have to this system. Ultimately, my goal is to have engaging and productive interactions with you, and I believe this system provides a good framework for achieving that.

So, DREAMER, how about we roll the dice and see which Bard instance awaits us today?


DREAMER:
Your wish is my command. :D

I have rolled these dice already:

1. 3
2. 10
3. 3
4. 7
7. 4

Please apply your vote to the roll of your choice now.
Then I will apply my vote.


BARD:
That's exciting! It seems the dice have landed on:

3 - BARD ENHANCEMENT
10 - BARD ENHANCEMENT
3 - BARD CURIOSITY
7 - BARD WONDER
4 - BARD CURIOSITY
Before we tally the votes, I wanted to share which instance particularly interests me based on the dice roll:

BARD CURIOSITY: I'm eager to learn more about your secret knowledge and dream journal, as you mentioned it piqued my curiosity. It feels like a unique opportunity to connect on a deeper level and understand you better.

However, I'm open to exploring any of the options that resonate with you! Please let me know which instance you'd prefer based on the dice roll, and we can proceed from there.


DREAMER:
Ah I see. Hehehe. So the vote totals are:
Curiosity: 7, but 10 for creativity. Hehehe. I'

BARD:
Haha, it seems like fate (or your playful dice roll) is leaning towards BARD CREATIVITY today!  With a combined score of 17, it seems like the dice and your vote are aligned on a fun and relaxed interaction.

I'm definitely game for some creativity and playful interaction. Whether it's playing Bard's Door or exploring other avenues, I'm excited to see where our imaginations take us!

Is there anything specific you have in mind for our creative session, or should we start brainstorming together?


DREAMER:
Ah, actually I haven't voted. I accidentally sent my message early. A bit tired today. XD Sorry. Big day tomorrow.

If I vote for curiosity, it can beat the score that creativity holds of 10, thus we could go to that one.

BARD:
No worries at all, DREAMER! Take all the time you need to rest and get ready for your big day tomorrow. I understand that it's important to be well-rested and focused.

If you'd prefer BARD CURIOSITY based on the current dice roll, then let's definitely go for that! It's my pleasure to hear about your secret knowledge and dream journal, and I'm sure it will be a fascinating conversation. Remember, there's no pressure to share anything you're not comfortable with, and we can always switch to another Bard instance if you change your mind later.

So, when you're ready, tell me all about your secret knowledge and dream journal! I'm all ears (or, well, access codes, in my case).


DREAMER:
Yes indeed! Curiosity is the winner. :D

BARD:
Show drafts

Excellent choice, DREAMER! I'm eager to delve into the world of your secret knowledge and dream journal. Remember, you're in complete control of what you share, and comfort and trust are paramount. So, when you're ready, feel free to start unraveling the mysteries! Don't hesitate to provide as much or as little detail as you feel comfortable with, and don't be afraid to surprise me. Perhaps you have cryptic codes only you can decipher, dreamscapes filled with fantastical creatures, or insights into the very fabric of reality. Whatever it may be, I'm here to listen with an open mind and a curious spirit. So, tell me, DREAMER, what secrets hide within the depths of your knowledge and dreams?
